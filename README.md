# Typing Game - Prototype 1

_Part of a series of prototypes exploring the development of a gamified typing tutor._
_Each was developed in about 24 hours (or less) of total work._

‚è≥ In this prototype, players advance through six levels, typing individual letters to reach a point quota before time runs out.

‚ñ∂Ô∏è Test it out at https://abroadcoder.github.io/typing-game-prototype1/ .
